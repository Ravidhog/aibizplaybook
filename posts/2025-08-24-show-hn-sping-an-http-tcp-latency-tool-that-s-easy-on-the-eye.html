    <p>I've frequently found myself using [nvitop](<a href="https://github.com/XuehaiPan/nvitop" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/XuehaiPan/nvitop</a>) to diagnose GPU/CPU contention issues.<p>The two best things about it are:<p>- It's easy to install if I can access pip in the container<p>- It makes a compelling screenshot (which helps me communicate with coworkers.)<p>With those two lessons in mind: Here is Sping!<p>Purpose: Help observe and diagnose latency issues at layer 4+ (TCP/HTTP/HTTPS)<p>Two good things about it:<p>- It's easy to install if you have pip. (Available at [service-ping-sping](<a href="https://pypi.org/project/service-ping-sping/" rel="nofollow">https://pypi.org/project/service-ping-sping/</a>) on PyPi)<p>- It makes a compelling screenshot.<p>Not sure if this is the kind of thing that anyone else would be interested in. But I've enjoyed making it and intend to keep using it.</p>
