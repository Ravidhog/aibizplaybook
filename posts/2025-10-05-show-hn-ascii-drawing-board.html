    <p>I've made an ASCII drawing board.
You can set any brush, canvas size, export art as a text file.<p>I want to keep it as manual/analog as possible, hence there is no tool for converting image to ASCII.<p>Prompting LLMs to draw ASCII art turned out to be a difficult task <i>.
So instead I decided to ask it make a drawing board. Wihtout coding agent I wouldn't even try myself. Although it is an interesting task, it would drift me away.<p>Basically it's just a drawing board with endless variations of textures and brushes: when you make large canvas and zoom out you don't see ASCII anymore, but textured drawing.
E.g. this is a cat: <a href="https://x.com/delopsu_com/status/1971726204073136219" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/delopsu_com/status/1971726204073136219</a>, brush used: " ".<p>I would appreciate if you could give it a try and tell your people about it, if it's something that may be of their interest.
Also please give any feedback here or on X.<p></i> turns out there is already (or is emerging) ASCII benchmark for LLMs.</p>
