    <p>Hi everyone,
I built FuseCells, a minimalistic logic puzzle game where every level is handcrafted (no procedural generation). It started as a personal challenge to design a clean rule-set and scale it to thousands of puzzles without losing difficulty balance.<p>What’s unique:
 • 2,500 handcrafted levels across multiple grid sizes
 • Deterministic logic — no guessing required
 • A rule system inspired by constraint-solving and path-finding concepts
 • Daily challenges and global progress tracking
 • Fully built as a solo dev project<p>Technical notes for those curious:
 • Level generation tools I wrote validate solvability using a custom constraint solver
 • Difficulty is estimated via step-count of the solver
 • The game is optimized to run smoothly on low-end devices
 • Designed first for iOS, now fully adapted for iPad as well<p>I’d love feedback from puzzle lovers, game designers, and anyone interested in handcrafted logic design.
Here’s the App Store link: [inserați linkul]<p>Thanks for reading — happy to answer any technical questions!</p>
