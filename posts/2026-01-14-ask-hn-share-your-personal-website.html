    <p>Hello HN!  I am putting together a community-maintained directory of personal websites at .  More details about the project can be found in the README at .<p>As you can see, the directory currently has only a handful of entries.  I need your help to grow it.  If you have a personal website, I would be glad if you shared it here.  If your website is hosted on a web space where you have full control over its design and content, and if it has been well received in past HN discussions, I might add it to the directory.  Just drop a link in the comments.  Please let me know if you do not want your website to be included in the directory.<p>Also, I intend this to be a community maintained resource, so if you would like to join the GitHub project as a maintainer, please let me know either here or via the IRC link in the README.<p>By the way, see also 'Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?' - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081 - July 2023 - (1014 points, 1940 comments).  In this post, the scope is not restricted to blogs though.  Any personal website is welcome, whether it is a blog, digital garden, personal wiki or something else entirely.<p>UPDATE: It is going to take a while to go through all the submissions and add them.  If you'd like to help with the process, please send a PR directly to this project: https://github.com/hnpwd/hnpwd.github.io</p>
