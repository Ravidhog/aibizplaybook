    <p>Hello all!<p>I've been an avid fan of Pocket Operators by Teenage Engineering since I found out about them. I even own an EP-133 K.O. II today, which I love.<p>A couple of months ago, Reddit user andiam03 shared a Google Sheet with some drum patterns [1]. I thought it was a very cool way to share and understand beats.<p>During the weekend I coded a basic version of this app I am sharing today. I iterated over it in my free time, and yesterday I felt like I had a pretty good version to share with y'all.<p>It's not meant to be a sequencer but rather a way to experiment with beats and basic sounds, save them, and use them in your songs. It also has a sharing feature with a link.<p>It was built using Tone.js [2], Stimulus [3] and deployed in Render [4] as a static website. I used an LLM to read the Tone.js documentation and generate sounds, since I have no knowledge about sound production, and modified from there.<p>Anyway, hope you like it! I had a blast building it.<p>[0]: <a href="https://teenage.engineering" rel="nofollow">https://teenage.engineering</a><p>[1]: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GMRWxEqcZGdBzJg52soeVaY7iUSj1YncfIJZIPScBhM/edit" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GMRWxEqcZGdBzJg52soe...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https://tonejs.github.io" rel="nofollow">https://tonejs.github.io</a><p>[3]: <a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev" rel="nofollow">https://stimulus.hotwired.dev</a><p>[4]: <a href="http://render.com" rel="nofollow">http://render.com</a></p>
