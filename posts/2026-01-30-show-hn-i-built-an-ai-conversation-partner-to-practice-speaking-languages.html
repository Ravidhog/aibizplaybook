    <p>Hi,<p>I built TalkBits because most language apps focus on vocabulary or exercises, but not actual conversation. The hard part of learning a language is speaking naturally under pressure.<p>TalkBits lets you have real-time spoken conversations with an AI that acts like a native speaker. You can choose different scenarios (travel, daily life, work, etc.), speak naturally, and the AI responds with natural speech back.<p>The goal is to make it feel like talking to a real person rather than doing lessons.<p>Techwise, it uses realtime speech input, transcription, LLM responses, and tts streaming to keep latency low so the conversation feels fluid.<p>I’m specially interested in feedback about:
– Does it feel natural?
– Where does the conversation break immersion?
– What would make you use this regularly?<p>Happy to answer technical questions too.<p>Thanks</p>
