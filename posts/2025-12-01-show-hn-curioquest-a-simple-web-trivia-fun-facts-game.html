    <p>I've been working on CurioQuest, a simple, clean trivia/fun facts game. It started as a little project for my friends and family and they've encouraged me to clean it up and make it public.<p>I'd love to get feedback from actual web game enthusiasts before adding the next batch of categories and questions!<p>This is not a commercial product; it's a labor of love that's still in development. It doesn't have all the planned categories yet, but there's reasonable content: little over 2600 questions, 7 categories, 4 levels of difficulty per category, 2 languages (English and Portuguese), PWA so you can "install" it on your phone or desktop.</p>
