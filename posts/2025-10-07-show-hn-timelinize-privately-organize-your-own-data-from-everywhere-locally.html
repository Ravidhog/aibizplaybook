    <p>Hey HN -- thanks for showing interest in this. Happy to collaborate on this project. I'm hoping to get it stable soon so my own family can start using it.<p>I've been working on this for about 10+ years, nights and weekends. It's been really slow going since I only have my own personal data to test it with.<p>I just don't love that my data is primarily stored on someone else's computer up in the cloud. I want my own local copy at least. And while I can download exports from my various accounts, I don't want them to just gather dust and rot on my hard drive.<p>So, Timelinize helps keep that data alive and relevant and in my control. I don't have as much worry if my cloud accounts go away. Hopefully you'll find it useful, and I hope we can collaborate.<p>(PS. I'm open to changing the name. Never really liked this one...)</p>
