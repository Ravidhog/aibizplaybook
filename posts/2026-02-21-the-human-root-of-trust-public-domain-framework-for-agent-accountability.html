    <p>I've spent my career at the intersection of identity, trust, and distributed systems. The thing I keep thinking about: every digital system we've built assumes a human is on the other end. Bank accounts, contracts, API keys — all designed around human singularity.<p>That assumption has already broken. AI agents are transacting, communicating, and signing contracts autonomously — passing identity checks designed for people, with no human visibly in the loop.<p>The Human Root of Trust is my attempt to name the problem and sketch the architecture: three pillars (proof of humanity, hardware-rooted device identity, action attestation), a six-step trust chain from human principal to cryptographic receipt, and two implementation paths.<p>It's dedicated to the public domain. No patent. No product. No ask except that whoever picks this up carries the principle forward.<p><a href="https://humanrootoftrust.org" rel="nofollow">https://humanrootoftrust.org</a></p>
