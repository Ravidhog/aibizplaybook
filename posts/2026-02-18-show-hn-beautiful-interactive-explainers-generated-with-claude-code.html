    <p>Hello HN,<p>Recently an amazingly beautiful explainer was shared on HN: <a href="https://explainers.blog/posts/why-is-the-sky-blue/" rel="nofollow">https://explainers.blog/posts/why-is-the-sky-blue/</a><p>I loved it so much that I wished more topics were explained that way. So, I decided to stress-test today's frontier models (Opus 4.6 in Claude Code) to generate similar explainer on any given topic WITH (almost) one shot and minimal nudging.<p>I'm launching with four topics: Fourier transformation, scaling laws in bio, cellular automata and LLMs.<p>I would let you be the judge, but I'm quite liking them.<p>Some things I learned:<p>- Prompting CC to test what it builds using headless chromium is essential
- There are subtle bugs in explanations (like in one animation human lifespan is 40 years)
- Asking CC to verify its plan via codex works really well<p>I do want to reiterate that the pages generated were mostly one-shot, which amazed me given how detailed the pages + animations are.</p>
