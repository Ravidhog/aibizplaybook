    <p>Hi HN — I’m exploring an idea and would love your feedback.<p>I’m a builder and user of Obsidian, validating a concept called Concerns. Today it’s only a landing page + short survey (no product yet) to test whether this pain is real.<p>The core idea (2–3 bullets):<p>- Many of us capture tons of useful info (notes/links/docs), but it rarely becomes shipped work.<p>- Instead of better “organization” (tags/folders), I’m exploring an “action engine” that:<p><pre><code>  1.detects what you’re actively targetting/working on (“active projects”)

  2.surfaces relevant saved material at the right moment

  3.proposes a concrete next action (ideally pushed into your existing task tool)
</code></pre>
My own “second brain” became a graveyard of good intentions: the organizing tax was higher than the value I got back. I’m trying to validate whether the real bottleneck is execution, not capture.<p>Before writing code, I’m trying to pin down two things:<p>- Project context signals (repo/PRs? issues? tasks? calendar? a “project doc”?)<p>- How to close the loop: ingest knowledge → rank against active projects → emit a small set of next-actions into an existing todo tool → learn from outcomes (done/ignored/edited) and optionally write back the minimal state. The open question: what’s the cleanest feedback signal without creating noise or privacy risk? (explicit ratings vs completion events vs doc-based write-back)<p>What I’m asking from you:<p>1.Where does your “second brain” break down the most?<p>capture / organization / retrieval / execution
(If you can, share a concrete recent example.)<p>2.What best represents “active project context” for you today?<p><pre><code>  task project (Todoist/Things/Reminders)

  issues/boards (GitHub/Linear/Jira)

  a doc/wiki page (Notion/Docs)

  calendar

  "in my head"
</code></pre>
Which one would you actually allow a tool to read?<p>3.What’s your hard “no” for an AI that suggests actions from your notes/links? (pick 1–2)<p><pre><code>  privacy/data retention

  noisy suggestions / interruption

  hallucinations / wrong suggestions

  workflow change / migration cost

  pricing

  others</code></pre></p>
