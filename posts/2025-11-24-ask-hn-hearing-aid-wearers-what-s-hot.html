    <p>One of my Phonak Audeo 90’s (RIC) died the other day after 5 years and I’m shopping for new. What’s your go to hearing aid currently if you’ve upgraded recently or have been thinking of doing so?<p>Moderate loss, have worn them for many years, enjoy listening to music and nature, but also need help in meetings and noisy environments.<p>Not worried about cost and wanting to get one more good deal out of work insurance before I retire.</p>
