    <p>The idea is actually quite simple. As a Japanese learner and a coder, I've always wanted there to be an open-source, 100% free for learning Japanese, similar to Monkeytype in the typing community.<p>Unfortunately, pretty much all language learning apps are closed-sourced and paid these days, and the ones that are free have unfortunately been abandoned.<p>But of course, just creating yet another language learning app was not enough - there has to be a unique selling point. And then I thought to myself: why not make it crazy and do what no other language learning app ever did by adding a gazillion different color themes and fonts, to really hit it home and honor the app's original inspiration, Monkeytype?<p>And so I did. Now, I'm looking to find contributors and testers for the early stages of the app.<p>Why? Because weebs and otakus deserve to have a 100% free, beautiful, quality language learning app tooÔºÅ<p>For anyone interested, you can check it out at --> <a href="https://kanadojo.com" rel="nofollow">https://kanadojo.com</a> and let me know what you think ^ ^</p>
