    <p>This started as a reaction to a conversational trope. Despite being a tranquil place, even conversations at my yoga studio often start with, "Can you believe what's going on right now?" with that angry/scared undertone.<p>I'm a news avoider, so I usually feel some smug self-satisfaction in those instances, but I wondered if there was a way to satisfy the urge to doomscroll without the anxiety.<p>My hypothesis: Apply a 40-year latency buffer. You get the intellectual stimulation of "Big Events" without the fog of war, because you know the world didn't end.<p>40 years creates a mirror between the Reagan Era and today. The parallels include celebrity populism, Cold War tensions (Soviets vs. Russia), and inflation economics.<p>The system ingests raw newspaper scans and uses a multi-step LLM pipeline to generate the daily edition:<p>OCR & Ingestion: Converts raw pixels to text.<p>Scoring: Grades events on metrics like Dramatic Irony and Name Recognition to surface stories that are interesting with hindsight. For example, a dry business blurb about Steve Jobs leaving Apple scores highly because the future context creates a narrative arc.<p>Objective Fact Extraction: Extracts a list of discrete, verifiable facts from the raw text.<p>Generation: Uses those extracted facts as the ground truth to write new headlines and story summaries.<p>I expected a zen experience. Instead, I got an entertaining docudrama. Historical events are surprisingly compelling when serialized over weeks.<p>For example, on Oct 7, 1985, Palestinian hijackers took over the cruise ship Achille Lauro. Reading this on a delay in 2025, the story unfolded over weeks: first they threw an American in a wheelchair overboard, then US fighter jets forced the escape plane to land, leading to a military standoff between US Navy SEALs and the Italian Air Force. Unbelievably, the US backed down, but the later diplomatic fallout led the Italian Prime Minister to resign.<p>It hits the dopamine receptors of the news cycle, but with the comfort of a known outcome.<p>Stack: React, Node.js (Caskada for the LLM pipeline orchestration), Gemini for OCR/Scoring.<p>Link: <a href="https://forty.news" rel="nofollow">https://forty.news</a> (No signup required, it's only if you want the stories emailed to you daily/weekly)</p>
