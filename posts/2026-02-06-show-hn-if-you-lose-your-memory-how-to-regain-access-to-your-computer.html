    <p>Due to bike-induced concussions, I've been worried for a while about losing my memory and not being able to log back in.<p>I combined shamir secret sharing (hashicorp vault's implementation) with age-encryption, and packaged it using WASM for a neat in-browser offline UX.<p>The idea is that if something happens to me, my friends and family would help me get back access to the data that matters most to me. 5 out of 7 friends need to agree for the vault to unlock.<p>Try out the demo in the website, it runs entirely in your browser!</p>
