    <p>Claude Code deleted my research and plan markdown files and informed me: “I accidentally rm -rf'd real directories in my Obsidian vault through a symlink it didn't realize was there: I made a mistake. “<p>Unfortunately the backup of my documentation accidentally hadn’t run for a month. So I built claude-file-recovery, a CLI-tool and TUI that is able to extract your files from your ~/.claude session history and thankfully I was able to recover my files. It's able to extract any file that Claude Code ever read, edited or wrote. I hope you will never need it, but you can find it on my GitHub and pip. Note: It can recover an earlier version of a file at a certain point in time.<p>pip install claude-file-recovery</p>
