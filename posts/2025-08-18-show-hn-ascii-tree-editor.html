    <p>Show HN: ASCII Tree Editor<p>I've created a web-based editor for ASCII file directory trees called asciitreeman. It's designed to make it easier to edit and reorganize the output of the tree command.<p>You can try it out here: <a href="https://reorx.github.io/asciitreeman/" rel="nofollow">https://reorx.github.io/asciitreeman/</a><p>And the source code is on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/reorx/asciitreeman" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/reorx/asciitreeman</a><p>Some of the key features include visual tree editing with drag-and-drop-like operations, real-time sync where changes are immediately reflected in the ASCII output, keyboard shortcuts for navigation (J/K or arrow keys), and auto-saving your work to local storage.<p>What's interesting is that I used Claude Code to "vibe-code" this project in a very short amount of time. It was a fun experiment in AI-assisted development. For those curious about the process, I've included the prompts and specifications I used in the source code. You can check them out in the spec.md and CLAUDE.md files in the repository.<p>Hop you find it useful!</p>
