  <main>
    <p>deff is an interactive Rust TUI for reviewing git diffs side-by-side with syntax highlighting and added/deleted line tinting. It supports keyboard/mouse navigation, vim-style motions, in-diff search (/, n, N), per-file reviewed toggles, and both upstream-based and explicit --base/--head comparisons. It can also include uncommitted + untracked files (--include-uncommitted) so you can review your working tree before committing.<p>Would love to get some feedback</p>
