    <p>As usual, there are countless immigration topics and I'll be guided by whatever you're concerned with. Please remember that I can't provide legal advice on specific cases for obvious liability reasons because I won't have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I'll do the same in my answers!<p>Previous threads we've done: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=proberts">https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=proberts</a>.</p>
