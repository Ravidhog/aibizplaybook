  <main>
    <p>I got tired of playwright-mcp eating through Claude's 200K token limit, so I built this using the new Claude Skills system. Built it with Claude Code itself.<p>Instead of sending accessibility tree snapshots on every action, Claude just writes Playwright code and runs it. You get back screenshots and console output. That's it.<p>314 lines of instructions vs a persistent MCP server. Full API docs only load if Claude needs them.<p>Same browser automation, way less overhead. Works as a Claude Code plugin or manual install.<p>Token limit issue: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/issues/889" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/issues/889</a><p>Claude Skills docs: <a href="https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills" rel="nofollow">https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills</a></p>
