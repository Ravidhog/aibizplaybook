    <p>Hi HN,<p>I built an open-source AI agent that has already indexed and can search the entire Epstein files, roughly 100M words of publicly released documents.<p>The goal was simple: make a large, messy corpus of PDFs and text files immediately searchable in a precise way, without relying on keyword search or bloated prompts.<p>What it does:<p>- The full dataset is already indexed
- You can ask natural language questions
- Answers are grounded and include direct references to source documents
- Supports both exact text lookup and semantic search<p>Discussion around these files is often fragmented. This makes it possible to explore the primary sources directly and verify claims without manually digging through thousands of pages.<p>Happy to answer questions or go into technical details.<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/nozomio-labs/nia-epstein-ai" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/nozomio-labs/nia-epstein-ai</a></p>
