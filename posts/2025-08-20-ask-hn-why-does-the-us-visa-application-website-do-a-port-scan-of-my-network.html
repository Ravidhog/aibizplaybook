    <p>I have recently installed this extension on FF: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/port-authority/" rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/port-authorit...</a> and yesterday I visited this website: <a href="https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/" rel="nofollow">https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/</a> and I got a notification that the website tried to do a port-scan of my private network.<p>Is this a common thing? I have just recently installed the extension, so I am not sure if there are a lot of other websites who do it.<p>Since looking into it, I noticed that uBlock Origin already has the default list "Block Outsider Intrusion into LAN" but it wasn't enabled.</p>
