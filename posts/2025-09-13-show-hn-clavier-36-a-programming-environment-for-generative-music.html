  <main>
    <p>CLAVIER-36 is a programming environment for generative music. Programs are laid out in a two-dimensional grid, and evolve over time according to a fixed set of rules. The system is much like a cellular automaton, in that most of the rules governing the evolution of the system are local.<p>C36 programs describe sequences of discrete events in time. The environment includes a primitive sampler, as a self-contained means of interpreting these events as sound. For full expressivity, though, the system is best used as a generator of data for interpretation by an external musical instrument, such as a synthesizer.<p>The project was very directly inspired by Orca (<a href="https://100r.co/site/orca.html" rel="nofollow">https://100r.co/site/orca.html</a>). It began as my own from-scratch implementation of Orca and diverged over time.<p>It's written in C, and compiled to WASM for the browser.<p>See the following pages for more info:<p>about page: <a href="https://clavier36.com/about" rel="nofollow">https://clavier36.com/about</a><p>user manual: <a href="https://clavier36.com/manual" rel="nofollow">https://clavier36.com/manual</a><p>tutorial video: <a href="https://youtu.be/rIpQmJVMjCA" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/rIpQmJVMjCA</a></p>
