    <p>I have been working on making WebRTC + Embedded Devices easier for a few years. This is a hackathon project that pulled some of that together. I hope others build on it/it inspires them to play with hardware. I worked on it with two other people and I had a lot of fun with some of the ideas that came out of it.<p>* Extendable/hackable - I tried to keep the code as simple as possible so others can fork/modify easily.<p>* Communicate with light. With function calling it changes the light bulb, so it can match your mood or feelings.<p>* Populate info from clients you control. I wanted to experiment with having it guide you through yesterday/today.<p>* Phone as control. Setting up new devices can be frustrating. I liked that this didn't require any WiFi setup, it just routed everything through your phone. Also cool then that they device doesn't actually have any sensitive data on it.</p>
