    <p>Too often I find myself being lazy with commit messages. But I don't want AI to write them for me... only i truly know why i wrote the code i did.<p>So why don't i get AI to help me get that into words from my head?<p>That's what i built: smartcommit asks you questions about your changes, then helps you articulate what you already know into a proper commit message. Captures the what, how, and why.<p>Built this after repeatedly being confused 6 months in a project as to why i made the change i had made...<p>Would love feedback!</p>
