    <p>I've always loved RTS games and wanted to make a game similar for a long time. I thought I'd just try and build a mini / puzzle game around the resource gathering aspects of an RTS.<p>Objective: You have a base at the center and you need to mine and "refine" all of the resources on the map in as short a time as possible.<p>By default, the game will play automatically, but not optimally (moving and buying  upgrades). You can disable that with the buttons. You can select drones and right click to move them to specific resources patches and buy upgrades as you earn upgrade points.<p>I've implemented three different levels and some basic sounds. I used Phaser at the game library (first time using it). It won't work well on a mobile.</p>
