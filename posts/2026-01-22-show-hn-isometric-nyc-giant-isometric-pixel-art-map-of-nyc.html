    <p>Hey HN! I wanted to share something I built over the last few weeks: isometric.nyc is a massive isometric pixel art map of NYC, built with nano banana and coding agents.<p>I didn't write a single line of code.<p>Of course no-code doesn't mean no-engineering. This project took a lot more manual labor than I'd hoped!<p>I wrote a deep dive on the workflow and some thoughts about the future of AI coding and creativity:<p><a href="http://cannoneyed.com/projects/isometric-nyc" rel="nofollow">http://cannoneyed.com/projects/isometric-nyc</a></p>
