    <p>Hi HN,<p>To truly understand how operating systems and network protocols work, I decided to combine two classic learning tools: the xv6 teaching OS and a from-scratch TCP/IP stack.<p>I'm excited to share the result: my own from-scratch TCP/IP networking stack running directly inside the xv6-riscv (<a href="https://github.com/pandax381/xv6-riscv-net" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/pandax381/xv6-riscv-net</a>) kernel.<p>The project uses a modern virtio-net driver, allowing it to run seamlessly in QEMU and communicate with the host machine.<p>Key features:<p>- From-Scratch Stack: The core is powered by microps (<a href="https://github.com/pandax381/microps" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/pandax381/microps</a>), a TCP/IP stack I originally wrote to run in user-space as a personal project to learn the low-level details of networking.<p>- Kernel Integration: This project ports microps from user-space into the xv6-riscv kernel.<p>- Socket API: Implements standard system calls (socket, bind, accept, etc.) to enable network application development.<p>- User-level Tools: Comes with a simple ifconfig command, plus tcpecho and udpecho servers to demonstrate its capabilities.<p>This has been a fantastic learning experience. My goal was to demystify the magic behind network-aware operating systems by building the components myself.<p>I'd love to hear your feedback and answer any questions!</p>
