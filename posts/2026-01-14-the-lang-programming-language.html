    <p>This afternoon I posted some tips on how to present a new* programming language to HN: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46608577">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46608577</a>. It occurred to me that HN has a tradition of posts called "The {name} programming language" (part of the long tradition of papers and books with such titles) and it might be fun to track them down. I tried to keep only the interesting ones:<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/thelang">https://news.ycombinator.com/thelang</a><p>Similarly, Show HNs of programming languages are at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/showlang">https://news.ycombinator.com/showlang</a>.<p>These are curated lists so they're frozen in time. Maybe we can figure out how to update them.<p>A few famous cases:<p><i>The Go Programming Language</i> - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=934142">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=934142</a> - Nov 2009 (219 comments)<p><i>The Rust programming language</i> - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1498528">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1498528</a> - July 2010 (44 comments)<p><i>The Julia Programming Language</i> - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3606380">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3606380</a> - Feb 2012 (203 comments)<p><i>The Swift Programming Language</i> - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7835099">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7835099</a> - June 2014 (926 comments)<p>But the obscure and esoteric ones are the most fun.<p>(* where 'new' might mean old, of course - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23459210">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23459210</a>)</p>
