    <p>- HN errored on all authenticated requests with 502 Bad Gateway. It did still respond to a limited amount of unauthenticated requests with presumably cached pages, which did not get updated. The last post on /newest claimed "0 minutes ago", but was actually much older (1:32:57 PM GMT) and not the newest post.<p>- This status page actually identified the outage: <a href="https://hackernews.onlineornot.com/" rel="nofollow">https://hackernews.onlineornot.com/</a> - Pages by Hund and Statuspal did not show the outage.<p>- The last post before the outage was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301823">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301823</a> (1:39:59 PM GMT). The last comment was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301848">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301848</a> (1:41:54 PM GMT).<p>- There was an average of ~4 seconds per comment just prior to the outage. Based on this, HN likely went down at 1:41:58 PM GMT.</p>
