    <p>I got tired of open file.docx → wait 8 seconds → close Word just to read a document, so I built a terminal-native Word viewer!<p>What it does:<p>* View `.docx` files directly in your terminal with (mostly) proper formatting<p>* Tables actually look like tables (with Unicode borders!)<p>* Nested lists work correctly with indentation<p>* Full-text search with highlighting<p>* Copy content straight to clipboard with `c`<p>* Export to markdown/CSV/JSON<p>Why I made this:<p>Working on servers over SSH, I constantly hit Word docs I needed to check quickly. The existing solutions I'm aware of either strip all formatting (docx2txt) or require GUI apps. Wanted something that felt as polished as [glow](<a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow</a>) but for Word documents.<p>The good stuff:<p>* 50ms startup vs Word's 8+ seconds<p>* Works over SSH (obviously)<p>* Preserves document structure and formatting<p>* Smart table alignment based on data types<p>* Interactive outline view for long docs<p>Built with Rust + ratatui and heavily inspired by Charm's [glow](<a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow</a>) package for viewing Markdown in the CLI (built in Go)!<p><pre><code>    # Install
    cargo install --git https://github.com/bgreenwell/doxx
    
    # Use
    doxx quarterly-report.docx
</code></pre>
Still early but handles most Word docs I throw at it. Always wanted a proper Word viewer in my terminal toolkit alongside `bat`, `glow`, and friends. Let me know what you think!</p>
