    <p>I made a built-from scratch Wayland Compositor to display any GUI app* in the terminal! I think there is a lot of unexplored potential in custom Wayland compositors, a lot of really cool things you can embed existing applications into! So, I started with embedding apps into the terminal because that is the easiest input/output (output is just utf-8 and I use the great `chafa` library for that, and I just read from stdin for the input).<p>If you have any other ideas for cool Wayland compositors, let me know. I purposedly wrote 80% the app in Typescript to appeal to the most developers and attract cool contributions (I do all drawing with the familiar Canvas2D api, so if there is interest, I can also fork this out into a cool Terminal canvas, let me know!)<p>I have a blog post here about how I did it, but it’s pretty high level and non technical, so please ask if you have any questions.<p>[How I Did It](<<a href="https://github.com/mmulet/term.everything/blob/main/resources/HowIDidIt.md" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/mmulet/term.everything/blob/main/resource...</a>>)<p>*technically only Wayland apps and x11 apps with Xwayland. But on Linux that’s mostly everything.</p>
