    <p>Hey HN – I built Dock after years of team chat frustrations as a founder.
Free forever for teams up to 5. Unlimited search, unlimited history. No "upgrade to see messages older than 90 days" nonsense.
Built for teams who work both async and sync/real-time when it matters. runs on SOC 2 infra, compliant, secure and in-transit and at-rest encryption, runs on Cloudflare.<p>Early stage – would love feedback from anyone who's felt the same pain.</p>
