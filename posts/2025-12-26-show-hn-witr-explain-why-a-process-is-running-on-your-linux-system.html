    <p>Hi HN,<p>I built a small Linux CLI tool called witr (Why Is This Running?).<p>The idea came from a situation most of us have hit: you log into a machine, see a process or port running, and immediately wonder why it exists, who started it, and what is keeping it alive right now.<p>witr traces a process, service, or port back to its origin and responsibility chain and explains it in a way that’s quick to read, especially when you’re debugging under pressure.<p>This is v0.1.0. It’s intentionally small and focused.
Feedback, criticism, and edge cases are very welcome.<p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/pranshuparmar/witr" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/pranshuparmar/witr</a></p>
