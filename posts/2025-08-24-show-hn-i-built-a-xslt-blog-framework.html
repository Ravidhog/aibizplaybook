    <p>A few weeks ago a friend sent me grug-brain XSLT (1) which inspired me to redo my personal blog in XSLT.<p>Rather than just build my own blog on it, I wrote it up for others to use and I've published it on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/vgr-land/vgr-xslt-blog-framework" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/vgr-land/vgr-xslt-blog-framework</a> (2)<p>Since others have XSLT on the mind, now seems just as good of a time as any to share it with the world. Evidlo@ did a fine job explaining the "how" xslt works (3)<p>The short version on how to publish using this framework is:<p>1. Create a new post in HTML wrapped in the XML headers and footers the framework expects.<p>2. Tag the post so that its unique and the framework can find it on build<p>3. Add the post to the posts.xml file<p>And that's it. No build system to update menus, no RSS file to update (posts.xml is the rss file). As a reusable framework, there are likely bugs lurking in CSS, but otherwise I'm finding it perfectly usable for my needs.<p>Finally, it'd be a shame if XSLT is removed from the HTML spec (4), I've found it quite eloquent in its simplicity.<p>(1) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44393817">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44393817</a><p>(2) <a href="https://github.com/vgr-land/vgr-xslt-blog-framework" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/vgr-land/vgr-xslt-blog-framework</a><p>(3) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44988271">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44988271</a><p>(4) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44952185">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44952185</a><p>(Aside - First time caller long time listener to hn, thanks!)</p>
