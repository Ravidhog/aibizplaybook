    <p>Hi HN,<p>When working with BGP data, I kept running into the same friction:
it’s easy to get raw data, but surprisingly hard to browse networks over time — especially by when they appeared, where they operate, and what they actually look like at a glance.<p>I built a small tool, bgpscout.io, to scratch that itch.<p>It lets you:<p>Browse ASNs by registration date and geography<p>See where a given network appears to have presence<p>View commonly scattered public data about an ASN in one place<p>Save searches to track when new networks matching certain criteria appear<p>All of this data is public already; the goal was to make exploration faster and less painful.<p>I haven’t invested heavily in expanding it yet. Before doing so, I’m curious:<p>Is this solving a real problem for you?<p>What would make something like this actually useful in day-to-day work?<p>Feedback is welcome.</p>
