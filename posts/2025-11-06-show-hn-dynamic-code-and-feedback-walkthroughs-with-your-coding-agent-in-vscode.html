  <main>
    <p>I've been programming since I'm 6 and I don't want to quit. Since Agents came into existence I've been increasingly building more of the random ideas.<p><i>BUT, like many</i> I kept getting stuck and frustrated where I wanted to make changes with the Agent that I <i>knew</i> I could've made without it but I had *no clue* how things worked.<p>I created Intraview to help me build and maintain a mental model of what I was building (or had vibed) so I could use my knowledge to either fix it myself, or provide more directed instruction. It grew into something that's transformed my workflow in a pleasant way.<p>Intraview is a VS Code extension that allows you to create:
  - Dynamic code tours built by your existing Agent 
  - Storage and sharing of tours (it's a file) 
  - Batch Feedback/commenting inline in IDE in-tour and without (it's also a file)<p>Here's a video walkthrough for the show vs tell crowd where I jump in a random (<i>Plotly JS</i>) open source repo and build a tour to get started: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROBvFlG6vtY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROBvFlG6vtY</a><p>Talking tech design, this is very different than most because the whole App is cloudless. Not server less, there's no external APIs (outside basic usage telemetry).<p><pre><code>  - basic TypeScript app, JS/CSS/HTML
  - Localhost MCP server inside VS Code (one per workspace open)
 </code></pre>
Three of the biggest challenges I faced was:<p><pre><code>  - re-considering the user experience given there's no database 
  - trying to build a reasonable experience to manage MCP connection across so many different setups.
  - testing the many forks, Agents and themes because I wanted to make it look native (I'll probably reverse course here in future iterations)
</code></pre>
What I'm curious about is, where do you see the value:<p><pre><code>  - New project/developer onboarding 
  - PR reviews 
  - Keeping up with Agentic code 
  - Perf reviews (for EM), you could build a tour biggest contributions by a GitHub handle
  - Planning alignment and review with your Agent
</code></pre>
You can see the extension page in VS Code with these custom links <i>(Note: this redirects and requires permission to open VS Code, won't actually install, takes another click)</i><p><pre><code>  - for VS Code: https://intraview.ai/install?app=vscode
  - for Cursor: https://intraview.ai/install?app=cursor
</code></pre>
Once it's installed and you confirm MCP is connected to your local server, just ask your Agent:<p><pre><code>  - Create an Intraview the onboarding for this app..
  - Let's use Intraview to gather my feedback on [whatever you created]. Break down steps such that I can provide good granular feedback.
</code></pre>
Looking forward to your feedback and discussion.<p>And because this is HN. A relevant quotable from PG.<p><pre><code>  “Your code is your understanding 
  of the problem you’re exploring. 
  So it’s only when you have your code 
  in your head that you really understand
   the problem.”
