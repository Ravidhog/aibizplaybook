    <p>Hi HN, we’re Neha and Akash from April (<a href="https://tryapril.com">https://tryapril.com</a>). We are building an AI executive assistant to help you get through emails and manage your schedule, hands-free while you drive to work, or whenever else you prefer voice interaction.<p>Here's a demo: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISKwEyuQQEo#t=50" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISKwEyuQQEo#t=50</a><p>...and here's a second one showing more complex use cases: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8APprJ3-eY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8APprJ3-eY</a>.<p>While driving 40 mins daily from SF to Berkeley, my inbox would flood to 30+ emails and I'd have back-to-back meetings lined up. I'd reach work already behind, then spend another hour just catching up. We figured with recent advances in voice AI, we could solve this dead time problem and start doing things on the go.<p>You can just speak to April and it can:<p>- Summarize important emails and flag what needs attention<p>- Send replies that I dictate (it handles the formatting and tone)<p>- Review my calendar and reschedule meetings on the fly<p>- Pull context from email threads for each meeting<p>- Archive/organize emails into folders<p>April is built using Deepgram for STT. Eleven Labs for TTS  - built on top of LiveKit. We built our own MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for Google integration, which handle auth, rate limiting, and maintain conversation context across email threads.<p>The most interesting part has been optimizing for lowest latency given we are a tool call heavy application. We are also trying to optimize the interruption handling and turn taking to make it feel more natural.<p>April is available on the AppStore (iPhone/iPad). You can try us out here <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/april-ai-executive-assistant/id6747432952">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/april-ai-executive-assistant/i...</a><p>Free 3-day trial, then $14.99/mo. We'd love feedback on: Which email /calendar workflows are most painful for you? What tools beyond Gmail & Google calendar would be most valuable with a voice interface?<p>We’ll be in the thread all day to answer any questions, share more technical details and learn what would make April most useful to you. Comment away!</p>
