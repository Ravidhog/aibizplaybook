    <p>Hey, I built <a href="https://ShadcnThemer.com" rel="nofollow">https://ShadcnThemer.com</a> - a web app for creating and sharing themes for shadcn/ui, made with my some of my favorites, Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS 4, Drizzle ORM, and Supabase.<p>The goal was to make it easy to visually design shadcn color themes, preview them live across various example UIs, and export them straight into your projects (as CSS or via the shadcn CLI registry command).<p>I had a bit of experience going into this because I built the Theme Studio for VS Code in the past, but it was fun using a modern stack and leveraging Cursor to help me along the way this time.<p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/miketromba/shadcn-themer" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/miketromba/shadcn-themer</a></p>
