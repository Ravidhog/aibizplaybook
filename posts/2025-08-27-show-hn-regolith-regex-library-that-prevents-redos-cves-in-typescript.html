  <main>
    <p>I wanted a safer alternative to RegExp for TypeScript that uses a linear-time engine, so I built Regolith.<p>Why:
Many CVEs happen because TypeScript libraries are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service attacks. I learned about this problem while doing undergraduate research and found that languages like Rust have built-in protection but languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python do not. This library attempts to mitigate these vulnerabilities for TypeScript and JavaScript.<p>How:
Regolith uses Rust's Regex library under the hood to prevent ReDoS attacks. The Rust Regex library implements a linear-time Regex engine that guarantees linear complexity for execution. A ReDoS attack occurs when a malicious input is provided that causes a normal Regex engine to check for a matching string in too many overlapping configurations. This causes the engine to take an extremely long time to compute the Regex, which could cause latency or downtime for a service. By designing the engine to take at most a linear amount of time, we can prevent these attacks at the library level and have software inherit these safety properties.<p>I'm really fascinated by making programming languages safer and I would love to hear any feedback on how to improve this project. I'll try to answer all questions posted in the comments.<p>Thanks!
