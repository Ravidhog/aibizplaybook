    <p>Hey HN! We’re Jason & Matt and we’re building Tweeks (<a href="https://tweeks.io">https://tweeks.io</a>), a browser extension that lets you modify any website in your browser to add functionality, filter/highlight, re-theme, reorganize, de-clutter, etc. If you’ve used Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey, Tweeks is like a next‑generation userscript manager. Instead of digging through selectors and hand‑writing custom JS/CSS, describe what you want in natural language and Tweeks plans + generates your edits and applies them.<p>The modern web is so full of clutter and junk (banners, modals, feeds, and recommendations you didn’t ask for). Even a simple google search is guarded by multiple ads, an AI overview, a trending searches module, etc. before you even see the first real blue link.<p>Every day there's a new Lovable-like product (make it simple to build your own website/app) or a new agentic browser (AI agents click around and browse the web for you), but we built Tweeks to serve the middle ground: most of our time spent on the web is on someone else's site (not our own), and we don't want to offload everything to an agentic browser. We want to be able to shape the entire web to our own preferences as we browse.<p>I spent years working on recommendation systems and relevance at Pinterest, and understand how well-meaning recommendations and A/B tests can lead to website enshittification. No one sets out to make UX worse, but optimizing for an “average” user is not the same as optimizing for each individual user.<p>I’ve also been hacking “page fixers” as long as I can remember: remove a login wall here, collapse cookie banners there, add missing filters/highlights (first with F12/inspect element and eventually graduated to advanced GreaseMonkey userscripts). Tweeks started as a weekend prototype that turned simple requests into page edits but unexpectedly grew into something people kept asking to share. We hope you’ll like it too!<p>How it works: Open the Tweeks extension, type your request (e.g. “hide cookie banners and add a price/quality score”), and submit. Upon submission, the page structure is captured, an AI agent reviews the structure, plans changes, and returns deterministic transformations (selectors, layout tweaks, styles, and small scripts) that run locally. Your modifications persist across page loads and can be enabled/disabled, modified, and shared.<p>Here are a bunch of one‑shot examples from early users:<p><i>Youtube</i>: Remove Youtube Shorts.

It’s currently free, but each use costs tokens so we'll likely need to cap usage to prevent abuse. We're more interested in early feedback than your money, so if you manage to hit the cap, message us at contact@trynextbyte.com or <a href="https://discord.gg/WucN6wpJw2" rel="nofollow">https://discord.gg/WucN6wpJw2</a>, tell us how you're using it/what features you want next, and we'll happily reset it for you.<p>Btw if you do anything interesting with it, feel free to make a shareable link (go to ‘Library’ and press ‘share’ after generating) and include it in the comments below. It’s fun to see the different things people are coming up with!<p>We're rapidly shipping improvements and would love your feedback and comments. Thanks for reading!</p>
