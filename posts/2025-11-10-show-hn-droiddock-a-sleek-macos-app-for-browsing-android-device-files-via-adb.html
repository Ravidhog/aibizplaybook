    <p>Hi HN,<p>I’m Rajiv, a software engineer turned Math teacher living in the mountains, where I like to slow down life while still building useful software.<p>I recently built DroidDock, a lightweight and modern macOS desktop app that lets you browse and manage files on your Android device via ADB. After 12 years in software development, I wanted a free, clean, and efficient tool because existing solutions were either paid, clunky, or bloated.<p>Features include multiple view modes, thumbnail previews for images/videos, intuitive file search, file upload/download, and keyboard shortcuts. The backend uses Rust and Tauri for performance.<p>You can download the latest .dmg from the landing page here: <a href="https://rajivm1991.github.io/DroidDock/" rel="nofollow">https://rajivm1991.github.io/DroidDock/</a>  
Source code is available on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/rajivm1991/DroidDock" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rajivm1991/DroidDock</a><p>I’d appreciate your feedback on usability, missing features, or bugs. Thanks for checking it out!<p>— Rajiv</p>
