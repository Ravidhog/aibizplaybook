    <p>Hi HN,<p>I recently noticed a recurring visual artifact in the "Most Replayed" heatmap on the YouTube player. The highest peaks were always surrounded by two dips. I got curious about why they were there, so I decided to reverse engineer the feature to find out.<p>This post documents the deep dive. It starts with a system design recreation, reverse engineering the rendering code, and ends with the mathematics.<p>This is also my first attempt at writing an interactive article. I would love to hear your thoughts on the investigation and the format.</p>
