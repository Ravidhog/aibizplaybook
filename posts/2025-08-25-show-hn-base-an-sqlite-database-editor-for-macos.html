    <p>I recently released v3 of Base, my SQLite editor for macOS.<p>The goal of this app is to provide a comfortable native GUI for SQLite, without it turning into a massive IDE-style app.<p>The coolest features are<p>- That it can handle full altering of tables, which is quite finicky to do manually with SQLite.<p>- It has a more detailed display of column constraints than most editors. Each constraint is shown as an icon if active, with full details available on clicking the icon.<p>This update also adds support for attaching databases, which is a bit fiddly with macOS sandboxing.<p>I'd love to hear any feedback or answer any questions.</p>
