    <h1>Ask HN: How to stop an AWS bot sending 2B requests/month</h1>

    <p>I have been struggling with a bot– 'Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; crawler)' coming from AWS Singapore – and sending an absurd number of requests to a domain of mine, averaging over 700 requests/second for several months now.
Thankfully, CloudFlare is able to handle the traffic with a simple WAF rule and 444 response to reduce the outbound traffic.<p>I've submitted several complaints to AWS to get this traffic to stop, their typical followup is:
We have engaged with our customer, and based on this engagement have determined that the reported activity does not require further action from AWS at this time.<p>I've tried various 4XX responses to see if the bot will back off, I've tried 30X redirects (which it follows) to no avail.<p>The traffic is hitting numbers that require me to re-negotiate my contract with CloudFlare and is otherwise a nuisance when reviewing analytics/logs.<p>I've considered redirecting the entirety of the traffic to aws abuse report page, but at this scall, it's essentially a small DDoS network and sending it anywhere could be considered abuse in itself.<p>Are there others that have similar experience?</p>
