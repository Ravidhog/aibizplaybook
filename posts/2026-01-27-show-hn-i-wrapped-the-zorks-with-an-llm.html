    <p>I grew up on the Infocom games and when microsoft actually open-sourced Zork 1/2/3 I really wanted to figure out how to use LLMs to let you type whatever you want, I always found the amount language that the games "understood" to be so limiting - even if it was pretty state of the art at the time.<p>So I figured out how to wrap it with Tambo.. (and run the game engine in the browser) basically whatever you type gets "translated" into zork-speak and passed to the game - and then the LLM takes the game's output and optionally adds flavor. (the little ">_" button at the top exposes the actual game input)<p>What was a big surprise to me is multi-turn instructions - you can ask it to "Explore all the rooms in the house until you can't find any more" and it will plug away at the game for 10+ "turns" at a time... like Claude Code for Zork or something</p>
