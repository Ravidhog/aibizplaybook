    <p>Different cultures celebrate Christmas at different days and time zones are a thing. But it's Christmas here, so:<p>Merry Christmas to everyone. I hope you get some rest and can spend time with people who are dear to you and get to focus on what's important rather than getting lost in stressing about everything having to be perfect.<p>Also much love to everyone who cannot spend their Christmas with dear people.<p>To make sure this post meets the relevancy criteria, here is a Wikipedia article about some Christmas (more precisely advent) tradition which I personally really like: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_market" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_market</a></p>
