    <p>Hi HN! I've recently been finding productivity in running parallel CLI coding agents(after not believing in them initially).<p>After having to do a ton of git stashing and branch fumbling, I decided I needed to something to more ergonomically run these agents in their own dedicated spaces.<p>I tried a lot of the existing products but they either were too convoluted or flat out didn't work. Some of them also seem to roll their own chat UI which I don't think is the right approach, I wanted to something to lightly wrap my terminal sessions.<p>So I built FleetCode! It uses git worktrees and let's you run multiple agents at once. It's made my multi agent coding workflow much easier.<p>It's free and open source, would love some feedback!</p>
