    <p>The use of the em dash (—) now raises suspicions that a text might have been AI-generated. Inspired by a suggestion from dang [1], I created a leaderboard of HN users according to how many of their posts before November 30, 2022—that is, before the release of ChatGPT—contained em dashes. Dang himself comes in number 2—by a very slim margin.<p>Credit to Claude Code for showing me how to search the HN database through Google BigQuery and for writing the HTML for the leaderboard.<p>[1] <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45053933">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45053933</a></p>
