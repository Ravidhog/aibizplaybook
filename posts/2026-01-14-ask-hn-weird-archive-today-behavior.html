    <p>archive.today has recently (I noticed this, like, 3 days ago) started automatically making requests to someone's personal blog on their CAPTCHA page.  Here's a screenshot of what I'm talking about: https://files.catbox.moe/20jsle.png<p>The relevant JS is:<p><pre><code>   setInterval(function() {
     fetch("https://gyrovague.com/?s=" + Math.round(new Date().getTime() % 10000000), {
       referrerPolicy: "no-referrer",
       mode: "no-cors"
     });
   }, 300);
</code></pre>
Looking at this blog, there seems to be exactly one article mentioning archive.today - "archive.today: On the trail of the mysterious guerrilla archivist of the Internet" (https://gyrovague.com/2023/08/05/archive-today-on-the-trail-of-the-mysterious-guerrilla-archivist-of-the-internet/), where the person running the blog digs up some information about archive's owner.<p>So perhaps this is some kind of revenge/DOS attack attempt/deliberately wasting their bandwidth in response to this article?  Maybe an attempt to silence them and force to delete their article?  But if it is, then I have so many questions.  Like, why would the owner of the archive do that <i>2.5 years</i> after the article was published?  Or why would they even do that in the first place, do they not know about Streisand effect?<p>I'm confused.</p>
