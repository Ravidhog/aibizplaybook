    <p>I wanted to share this fun craft activity for the holidays that I've been doing with my family over the last few years.  I came up with these while cutting up some cans trying to make an aluminum version of paper spinners.<p>There are a variety of shapes that work, but generally bigger+lighter spinners are better.  Also incandescent bulbs are the best, but LEDs work too.<p>They remind me of candle carousels I would see at my grandparents' house during Christmas.  Let me know what you think!</p>
