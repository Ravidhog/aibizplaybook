    <p>AI generates complete novels with cover art, ready for print Text: I built a tool that generates complete, print-ready books from a single concept. Enter your idea, pick a genre and length, and you get:
Full manuscript PDF (formatted for print with title page, copyright, chapters)
Editable DOCX file
AI-generated cover art
Print-ready cover PDF with spine
The whole thing takes a few minutes. Output is sized for standard trim sizes so you can upload directly to KDP or other print-on-demand services. Built with Claude for the writing and image generation for covers. Priced starting at $19. Would love feedback on the concept and output quality. <a href="https://printreadybook.com" rel="nofollow">https://printreadybook.com</a></p>
