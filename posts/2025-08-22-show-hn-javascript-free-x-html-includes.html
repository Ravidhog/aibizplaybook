    <p>(spoiler: its XSLT)<p>I've been working on a little demo for how to avoid copy-pasting header/footer boilerplate on a simple static webpage. My goal is to approximate the experience of Jekyll/Hugo but eliminate the need for a build step before publishing. This demo shows how to get basic templating features with XSL so you could write a blog post which looks like<p><pre><code>  
  
  
      My Article
      
          some content
          <ul>
              <li>hello</li>
              <li>hello</li>
          </ul>
      
  
</code></pre>
Some properties which set this approach apart from other methods:<p><pre><code>  - no build step (no need to setup Jekyll on the client or configure Github/Gitlab actions)
  - works on any webserver (e.g. as opposed to server-side includes, actions)
  - normal looking URLs (e.g. `example.com/foobar` as opposed to `example.com/#page=foobar`)
</code></pre>
There's been some talk about removing XSLT support from the HTML spec [0], so I figured I would show this proof of concept while it still works.<p>[0]: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44952185">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44952185</a><p>See also: grug-brain XSLT <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44393817">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44393817</a></p>
