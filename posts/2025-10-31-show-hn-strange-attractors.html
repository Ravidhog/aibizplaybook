    <p>I went down the rabbit hole on a side project and ended up building this: Strange Attractors(<a href="https://blog.shashanktomar.com/posts/strange-attractors" rel="nofollow">https://blog.shashanktomar.com/posts/strange-attractors</a>). It’s built with three.js.<p>Working on it reminded me of the little "maths for fun" exercises I used to do while learning programming in early days. Just trying things out, getting fascinated and geeky, and being surprised by the results. I spent way too much time on this, but it was extreme fun.<p>My favorite part: someone pointed me to the Simone Attractor on Threads. It is a 2D attractor and I asked GPT to extrapolate it to 3D, not sure if it’s mathematically correct, but it’s the coolest by far. I have left all the params configurable, so give it a try. I called it Simone (Maybe).<p>If you like math-art experiments, check it out. Would love feedback, especially from folks who know more about the math side.</p>
