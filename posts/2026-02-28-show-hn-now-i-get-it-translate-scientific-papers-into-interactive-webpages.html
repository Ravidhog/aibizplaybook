    <p>Understanding scientific articles can be tough, even in your own field. Trying to comprehend articles from others? Good luck.<p>Enter, Now I Get It!<p>I made this app for curious people. Simply upload an article and after a few minutes you'll have an interactive web page showcasing the highlights. Generated pages are stored in the cloud and can be viewed from a gallery.<p>Now I Get It! uses the best LLMs out there, which means the app will improve as AI improves.<p>Free for now - it's capped at 20 articles per day so I don't burn cash.<p>A few things I (and maybe you will) find interesting:<p>* This is a pure convenience app. I could just as well use a saved prompt in Claude, but sometimes it's nice to have a niche-focused app. It's just cognitively easier, IMO.<p>* The app was built for myself and colleagues in various scientific fields. It can take an hour or more to read a detailed paper so this is like an on-ramp.<p>* The app is a place for me to experiment with using LLMs to translate scientific articles into software. The space is pregnant with possibilities.<p>* Everything in the app is the result of agentic engineering, e.g. plans, specs, tasks, execution loops. I swear by Beads (<a href="https://github.com/steveyegge/beads" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/steveyegge/beads</a>) by Yegge and also make heavy use of Beads Viewer (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46314423">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46314423</a>) and Destructive Command Guard (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46835674">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46835674</a>) by Jeffrey Emanuel.<p>* I'm an AWS fan and have been impressed by Opus' ability to write good CFN. It still needs a bunch of guidance around distributed architecture but way better than last year.</p>
