    <p>I kept missing appointments and meetings because calendar notifications are too easy to ignore. Alarms, on the other hand, always break through silent mode/DND and force you to acknowledge them — but setting them manually every day was another chore.<p>With iOS 26’s new AlarmKit, I built Beacon: it automatically syncs with your Apple Calendar and converts important events into real iOS alarms. You can define simple rules (like “only events with ‘Interview’ in the title” or “meetings with 3+ attendees”), and Beacon sets the alarms for you — no extra work required.<p>Would love feedback!</p>
