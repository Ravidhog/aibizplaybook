    <p>Mobile first open-source RSVP platform. Alternative for meetup.com / eventribe for small companies and groups. If you have a small group and don't want to pay for services you can easily selfhost this solution. Open for improvements and for feedback, ofc.<p>- One-Click Sharing - Each event gets a unique, memorable URL. Share instantly via any platform or messaging app.
- No Hassle, No Sign-Ups - Skip registrations and endless forms. Unlike other event platforms, you create and share instantly — no accounts, no barriers.
- Effortless Simplicity - Designed to be instantly clear and easy. No learning curve — just open, create, and go.</p>
