    <p>Hello everyone! I created a short game in just a few days, just for fun, where you play as an ant and feed it apples<p>This game also features random landscape generation, with clouds and trees arranged in a chaotic pattern across all coordinates. This is what took me the longest time :)<p>I would appreciate your feedback ^ ^</p>
