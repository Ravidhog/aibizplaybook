  <main>
    <p>Traceformer.io is a web application that ingests KiCad projects or Altium netlists along with relevant datasheets, enabling LLM-based schematic review. The system is designed to identify datasheet-driven schematic issues that traditional ERC tools can't detect.<p>Since our first launch (formerly as Netlist.io), we've made some big changes:<p>- Full KiCad project parsing via an open-source plugin<p>- Pass-through API pricing with a small platform fee<p>- Automatic datasheet retrieval<p>- ERC/DRC-style review UI<p>- Revamped review workflow with selectable frontier models (GPT 5.2, Opus 4.5, and more)<p>- Configurable review parameters (token limits, design rules, and parallel reviews)<p>Additionally, we continue to offer a free plan which lets you evaluate a design before subscribing. We're looking forward to hearing your feedback!</p>
