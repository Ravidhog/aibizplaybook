    <p>I built Nogic, a VSCode extension currently, because AI tools make code grow faster than developers can build a mental model by jumping between files. Exploring structure visually has been helping me onboard to unfamiliar codebases faster.<p>It’s early and rough, but usable. Would love feedback on whether this is useful and what relationships are most valuable to visualize.</p>
