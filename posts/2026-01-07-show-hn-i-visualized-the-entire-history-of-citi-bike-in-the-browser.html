    <p>Each moving arrow represents one real bike ride out of 291 million, and if you've ever taken a Citi Bike before, you are included in this massive visualization!<p>You can search for your ride using Cmd + K and your Citi Bike receipt, which should give you the time of your ride and start/end station.<p>Everything is open source: <a href="https://github.com/freemanjiang/bikemap" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/freemanjiang/bikemap</a><p>Some technical details:
- No backend! Processed data is stored in parquet files on a Cloudflare CDN, and queried directly by DuckDB WASM<p>- deck.gl w/ Mapbox for GPU-accelerated rendering of thousands of concurrent animated bikes<p>- Web Workers decode polyline routes and do as much precomputation as possible off the main thread<p>- Since only (start, end) station pairs are provided, routes are generated by querying OSRM for the shortest path between all 2,400+ station pairs</p>
