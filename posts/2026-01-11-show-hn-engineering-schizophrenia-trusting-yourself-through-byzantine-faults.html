    <p>Hi HN!<p>My name's Robert Escriva. I got my PhD from Cornell's Computer Science department back in 2017.  And three years ago I had a psychotic episode that irreversibly shook up my world.<p>Since then I've been applying a skill I learned in grad school---namely, debugging distributed and complex systems---to my own mind.<p>What I've found I've put into a [book (pdf)](<a href="https://rescrv.net/engineering-schizophrenia.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://rescrv.net/engineering-schizophrenia.pdf</a>) on engineering, my particular schizophrenic delusions, and how people who suffer as I once did can find a way through the fog to the other side.<p>This is not a healing memoir; it is a guide and a warning for all those who never stopped to ask,
"What happens if my brain begins to fail me?"<p>I am writing because what I've found is not a destination, but a process. It is an ongoing process for me and for people like me. I also believe it is automate-able using the same techniques we apply to machine-based systems.<p>I am looking for others who recognize the stakes of the human mind to engage in discussion on the
topic.<p>Happy hacking,
Robert</p>
