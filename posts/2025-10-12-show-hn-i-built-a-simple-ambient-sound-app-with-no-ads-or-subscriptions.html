    <p>I’ve always liked having background noise while working or falling asleep, but I got frustrated that most “white noise” or ambient sound apps are either paywalled, stuffed with ads, or try to upsell subscriptions for basic features.<p>So I made Ambi, a small iOS app with a clean interface and a set of freely available ambient sounds — rain, waves, wind, birds, that sort of thing. You can mix them, adjust volume levels, and just let it play all night or while you work. Everything works offline and there are no hidden catches.<p>It’s something I built for myself first, but I figured others might find it useful too.
Feedback, bugs, and suggestions are all welcome.<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/ambi-white-noise-sleep-sounds/id6753184615">https://apps.apple.com/app/ambi-white-noise-sleep-sounds/id6...</a></p>
