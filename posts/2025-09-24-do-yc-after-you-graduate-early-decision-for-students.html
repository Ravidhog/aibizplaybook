    <p>We announced something today at YC called Early Decision, specifically for students.  It's a relatively small change, but we thought people might be interested to hear the thinking behind it, even if you don't happen to be a student graduating this year.<p>A year ago, YC went from running 2 batches / year to 4 batches / year.  We did this because we wanted to give founders more flexibility to do YC at the right time for them.  It seems to have worked - a lot of founders have told us that they were only able to do YC because the new schedule fit their timeline.<p>Early Decision was driven by the same motivation.  We talked to a lot of college students, and we learned that most graduating seniors interview for their after-graduation job in the fall of their senior year.  For the ones who are interested in doing their own startup, this creates a bit of a dilemma.  If they don't interview for jobs in the fall in order to apply to YC later, they're risking that they might be left without any options.<p>We created Early Decision so that they can apply to YC at the same time they're doing recruiting for regular jobs, the fall of their senior year.  If they get into YC, they can confidently turn down their other job offers without worrying they'll be left without anything.<p>Note: this isn't really a new idea.  We've quietly done this from time to time since 2018, but we didn't create a dedicated flow in the application software for it, so most people didn't realize it was an option.  Hopefully by productizing and popularizing it, we'll make it easier for college seniors to start companies.</p>
