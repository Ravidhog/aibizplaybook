    <p>Hey HN! I built a proof-of-concept for AI memory using Git instead of vector databases.<p>The insight: Git already solved versioned document management. Why are we building complex vector stores when we could just use markdown files with Git's built-in diff/blame/history?<p>How it works:<p>Memories stored as markdown files in a Git repo
Each conversation = one commit
git diff shows how understanding evolves over time
BM25 for search (no embeddings needed)
LLMs generate search queries from conversation context
Example: Ask "how has my project evolved?" and it uses git diff to show actual changes in understanding, not just similarity scores.<p>This is very much a PoC - rough edges everywhere, not production ready. But it's been working surprisingly well for personal use. The entire index for a year of conversations fits in ~100MB RAM with sub-second retrieval.<p>The cool part: You can git checkout to any point in time and see exactly what the AI knew then. Perfect reproducibility, human-readable storage, and you can manually edit memories if needed.<p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Growth-Kinetics/DiffMem" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/Growth-Kinetics/DiffMem</a><p>Stack: Python, GitPython, rank-bm25, OpenRouter for LLM orchestration. MIT licensed.<p>Would love feedback on the approach. Is this crazy or clever? What am I missing that will bite me later?</p>
