    <p>I've been working on this for some time now, starting with vm2, then deno-core for 2 years, and recently rewrote it on rusty_v8 with Claude's help.<p>OpenWorkers lets you run untrusted JS in V8 isolates on your own infrastructure. Same DX as Cloudflare Workers, no vendor lock-in.<p>What works today: fetch, KV, Postgres bindings, S3/R2, cron scheduling, crypto.subtle.<p>Self-hosting is a single docker-compose file + Postgres.<p>Would love feedback on the architecture and what feature you'd want next.</p>
